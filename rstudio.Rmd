# Installing and the basics of R Studio

Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

After opening R Studio, you will see the menu bar and four different panes.

$~$

Here is an overview explaining what the different panes are used for:

1. Scripting window: for typing commands

2. Console: for typing commands and to see the output of each

3. Top right side with three tabs:
  + Environment: showing all active objects
  + History: showing list of commands
  + Connections: to connect, explore, and view data in a variety of databases
  
4. Bottom right side with five tabs:
  + Files: your default workspace
  + Plots: showing graphs that you generate
  + Packages: packages contain collections of R functions, data, and compiled
code, and are used to make graphs, maps and so on
  + Help: additional info
  + Viewer: showing interactive plots and graphs

# Create a leaflet map

Start with the installation of the leaflet package.

`install.packages("leaflet")`

After calling the leaflet library, two lines of code will create your first map.

```{r, fig.width = 8.4, fig.height = 6}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles()
```

# View and basemap

Let's set the view by defining a set of coordinates and the zoom level, and add a different basemap (leaflet will use Open Street Map by default). [Here](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) you can find a wide range of options for the basemap. 

```{r, fig.width = 8.4, fig.height = 6}
leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = -15, lat = 20, zoom = 2) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatter)
```

# Marker

You can easily add a marker by defining a set of coordinates and using `addMarker()`. The example here is the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world's oceans.

```{r, fig.width = 8.4, fig.height = 6}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = 142, lat = 11, zoom = 3) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = 142.1999992, lat = 11.3499986) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.OceanBasemap)
```

# Polyline

Let's add the Equator to the map using the `addPolylines()`. 

```{r, fig.width = 8.4, fig.height = 6}

x = c(-180, 180)
y = c(0, 0)
e = data.frame(x, y)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = 0, lat = 0, zoom = 2) %>%
  addPolylines(lng = e$x, lat = e$y, color = "red") %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.OceanBasemap)
```
